# rust-cowsay
This is planned to be a simplified implementation of cowsay to help me (and anyone else) learn rust and github.

Planned usage for this command-line program is ` ./rust-cowsay "hello world!" `

Todo includes:
* add ascii of original cow
* add rust mascot
* speech bubble width based on input length
* accept argument for setting multiple lines manually
* parse input for words if length is greater than maximum length and break input into multiple lines
